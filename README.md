# To-Do-List-App
A simple command-line To-Do List App built using Python for my CS50P final project. It lets users add, view, and delete tasks with all data stored in a text file. The app helps users stay organized, remember daily goals, and reduce procrastination. Includes error handling and testing. 

# üë©‚Äçüíª About the Project

Hello I'm Ayushi Sharma and this is my final project for CS50P. I've made a very simple yet useful "To-Do List App" which I've created by using Python.

The main idea that i've used behind this project is basically to help users keep the track of their daily tasks from the command line. With this app users can:

(i) Add new tasks to their to-do list according to thier own preference
(ii) They can easily view all the tasks
(iii) They can also remove completed tasks
(iv) And can simply exit the app

I've made a file called as `tasks.txt` in which the user lists get stored and their data will be kept safe even after they close the program.

# üß† What I Learned through this Project

Through this project I've got hands-on experience with:

(i) How to handle file in Python (`open`, `read`, `write`)
(ii) How to use command-line arguments via the `sys` module
(iii) How to write and organize functions in a clean manner
(iv) How to write test cases using the `pytest`
(v) And mainly I developed a real-world Python project which feels like a great achivement to me.

Honestly speaking it was very exciting to bring everything that I‚Äôve learned into one working program!

# üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

To use this app, the user just have to run the program from the terminal:
Let me explain it in simple words- after running the program simply type the similar versions that you eant as given below:

(i) Type `python project.py` then type `add` then type `Buy groceries`. This will automatically add 'buy groceries" in your list!
(ii) Similarly type `python project.py` then type `view`.   This will show all tasks!
(iii) Similarly for this `python project.py` then type `delete` then type the number of task that you want to delete for example  `1` . This will delete the task at position 1.
(iv) If the user typed any invalid input then the program will simply give a warning tag also.

Each task is saved in a simple `tasks.txt` file which will be available to the users in simple readable text format. I've designed this program in such a way that it will read directly and automatically print it in the task.txt folder.

# üß™ Testing

I've also created a `test_project.py` file in order to test the main functions like adding, vewing, and removing tasks using the `pytest`. This test project has helped to confirm and build confidence that i got the exact Output As i imagined.

# üå∏ Final Thoughts

I created this To-Do List App because I personally find it helpful to stay organized, remember important tasks, and stay motivated by visually tracking my progress. This project genuinely gave me an opportunity to apply what I've learned so far in CS50P. I know it‚Äôs simple but it has taught me how to think like a programmer. I‚Äôm really proud of building something from scratch that actually works!

THANKYOU FOR YOUR PRECIOUS TIME‚ù§Ô∏è
